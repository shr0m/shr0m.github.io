      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring Ethical Hacker interested in all things tech. I take particular interest in network and wireless security, and study Cyber Security concepts in my free time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I started my IT journey when I was 12 years old, where saw a youtuber named NetworkChuck upload his journey to become an Ethical Hacker. I was hooked from the beginning. Programming wasn't really my main interest, and I took to testing everything I saw early on. Like a true script kiddie, I believed every dark web story online, tested LOIC on my own computer, and amassed an impressive 1300 security alerts on my poor laptop.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I'd like to think I've improved as I went along, and I now religiously keep a HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe streak to keep my learning consistent. My immediate concern is my A-Level exams. But I am preparing to take my Certified Bug Bounty Hunter exam later in the year.</p>

      <h3>My Time in Air Cadets</h3>
      <p>I joined the UK's RAF Air Cadets in June 2020, in the heat of the global Covid pandemic. For the first year, I only attended virtual parade nights and events, which almost made me leave the organisation. However, we managed to get back to physical activities, and I found myself in a brilliant environment, where each event is an opportunity to improve my personal skills and make friends.</p>

      <p>After 4 years of camps, activities and courses, I am now a Sergeant, where I take a more active role in the training of others. My role within my squadron is overseeing all radio and cyber training, which involves teaching radio principles and basic physics, which also aids me in my A levels. Being a cadet SNCO has provided me with crucial management and presentation skills.</p>

      <h3>My journey in Cyber Security</h3>
      <p>During my GCSE years, I studied on HackTheBox and TryHackMe, joining a CTF Team to participate in HTB Seasons, a gameified version of a real hacking CTF. Whilst in this team, I advanced my skills in enumeration and fuzzing, building a crucial patience and belief in my own abilities, while also providing another pair of hands for my team. This was also around the time I started building a learning streak on HTB Academy, progressing slowly through the Certified Bug Bountry Hunter path, with the aim of obtaining the certification.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      I obtained my first real certification after being recommended it by one of my Cadet Civilian Instructors, the ISC2 Certified in Cyber (CC) certitification. This covered basic business continuity and disaster recovery, as well as fundamental levels of access control and defensive security. It was around this time where I also participated in Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest Competition. This built my C# and python skills, as well as my teamwork and cooperation skills.
