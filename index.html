      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring Ethical Hacker interested in all things tech. I take particular interest in network and wireless security, and study Cyber Security concepts in my free time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I started my IT journey when I was 12 years old, where saw a youtuber named NetworkChuck upload his journey to become an Ethical Hacker. I was hooked from the beginning. Programming wasn't really my main interest, and I took to testing everything I saw early on. Like a true script kiddie, I believed every dark web story online, tested LOIC on my own computer, and amassed an impressive 1300 security alerts on my poor laptop.</p>

      <p>I'd like to think I've improved as I went along, and I now religiously keep a HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe streak to keep my learning consistent. My immediate concern is my A-Level exams. But I am preparing to take my Certified Bug Bounty Hunter exam later in the year.</p>

      <h3>My Time in Air Cadets</h3>
      <p>I joined the UK's RAF Air Cadets in June 2022, in the heat of the global Covid pandemic. For the first year, I only attended virtual parade nights and events, which almost made me leave the organisation. However, we managed to get back to physical activities, and I found myself in a brilliant environment, where each night is an opportunity to improve my personal skills and make friends.</p>
